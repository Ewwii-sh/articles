To get started with ewwii, we recommend installing both `ewwii` and `eiipm`.

What is eiipm, you may ask. Simply put, it's a package manager which will allow you to install tools from the ewwii ecosystem.

### Installing

There are 3 ways through which you can install ewwii/eiipm:

- Through the installer (recommended but only for Linux).
- Building yourself (recommended).
- Installing via [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/).

#### Using the installer

This is the simplest and fastest method through which you can install ewwii/eiipm (based on your choice).

Simply run the following command and follow the instructions to have them installed in no time:

```bash
$ curl -sSL https://ewwii-sh.github.io/install.sh | install.sh
```

#### Building from source

If you are not on Linux, then this is the recommended approach for you.

Before you build from source, make sure that you have [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) installed.

##### **Step-1:** Cloning

To start off, you should clone the repository of ewwii.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Ewwii-sh/ewwii.git
```

##### Step-2: Checkout the cloned repository

Enter into the cloned repository with `cd`.

```bash
$ cd ewwii
```

##### Step-3: Building

Now that you are in the ewwii source code. Run the following command to start building it:

```bash
$ cargo build --release
```

##### Step-4: Moving to `/usr/local/bin`

Now that you compiled ewwii, you can find a binary named `ewwii` in `./target/release/`. Now you have to copy that to `/usr/local/bin` so that it will be globally accessable.

```bash
$ sudo cp ./target/release.ewwii /usr/local/bin/
```

##### Step-5: Installing eiipm

Now that you have ewwii ready, repeat the same steps after cloning `https://github.com/Ewwii-sh/eiipm.git`.

```bash
# Step-1: Clone
$ git clone https://github.com/Ewwii-sh/eiipm.git
# Step-2: Enter
$ cd eiipm
# Step-3: Build
$ cargo build --release
# Step-4: Copy
$ sudo cp ./target/release/eiipm /usr/local/bin/
```

#### Installing through Cargo

Installing ewwii/eiipm through cargo is not really recommended because it installs them to `~/.cargo/bin` which is not a global destination. Sure, you may be able to access it, but other programs may not.

If really want to install through cargo, then you can run the commands shown below to install ewwii and eiipm.

Installing ewwii through cargo:

```bash
$ cargo install --git https://github.com/Ewwii-sh/ewwii
```

Installing eiipm through cargo:

```bash
$ cargo install --git https://github.com/Ewwii-sh/eiipm
```

### Next steps

Now that you have ewwii and potentially eiipm as well, we can move on to the next step--reading the documentation.

You can use the following links to reach the documentation of both ewwii and eiipm.
